# Exercise Database
An exercise database that consists of exercise descriptions with tutorial videos. Includes various information that will help you filter exercises to meet your needs. Such as difficulty level, equipment used, body part worked and more.

I'm populating this database for a workout generator web app since I couldn't find an existing database with the content I needed. Feel free to use the info for your own cool creations.

**Current focus:** Working on bodyweight-only exercises at the moment. I will one day create an API for it, but today is not that day. 


##Things to know about existing filters

###Difficulty level
**Easy:** These are exercises that would be given to someone who has little or no experience exercising. And/or someone who is very out of shape and needs to slowly increase strength and mobility. Exercises include arm circles, wall push-ups, and chair squats. 

**Medium:** Exercises that someone with an average level of fitness would be able to complete. Things like squats, push-ups, and burpees. 

**Hard:** Better suited for those who are already in good physical condition with a good amount of exercise experience. 

###Body parts
Currently split into upper, lower, full body, and core.
